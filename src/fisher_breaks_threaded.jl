    fisher_breaks_threaded(x::Vector{<:Real}, k::Integer) -> Vector{Float64}

Calculate Fisher's natural breaks for a vector of values using multi-threading.

# Arguments
- `x::Vector{<:Real}`: Vector of observations to be clustered.
- `k::Integer`: Number of classes (will result in k+1 break points).

# Returns
- `Vector{Float64}`: Vector of break points including minimum and maximum values.

# Details
- This function is a threaded version of Fisher's method of exact optimization.
- For large datasets, this implementation can provide performance improvements
  on multi-core systems by parallelizing parts of the algorithm.
- Uses `Threads.@threads` to parallelize suitable parts of the computation.

# Examples
```julia
using Threads  # Make sure threading is enabled
x = rand(10000)
k = 5
breaks = fisher_breaks_threaded(x, k)
```

    fisher_clustering_threaded(x, k)

Threaded version of Fisher's clustering algorithm that maximizes the
