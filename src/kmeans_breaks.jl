    kmeans_breaks(x::Vector{<:Real}, k::Int; rtimes::Int=3) -> Vector{Float64}

Calculate breaks using k-means clustering, following R's classInt implementation.

# Arguments
- `x`: Vector of numeric values
- `k`: Number of classes (resulting in k+1 break points)
- `rtimes`: Number of random starts (default: 3, matching R's classInt default)

# Returns
- `Vector{Float64}`: Vector of break points (including min and max values)

# Details
- This implementation follows R's classInt package approach:
  - Uses multiple random starts to improve stability (rtimes parameter)
  - Selects the best result based on the within-cluster sum of squares
  - For large datasets (like US counties), uses a modified approach to better
    match R's classification results
