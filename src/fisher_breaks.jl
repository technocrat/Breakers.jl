    fisher_breaks(x::Vector{<:Real}, k::Integer) -> Vector{Float64}

Calculate Fisher's natural breaks for a vector of values.

# Arguments
- `x::Vector{<:Real}`: Vector of observations to be clustered.
- `k::Integer`: Number of classes (will result in k+1 break points).

# Returns
- `Vector{Float64}`: Vector of break points including minimum and maximum values.

# Details
- This function uses Fisher's method of exact optimization to find optimal class breaks.
- Fisher's method maximizes the between-class sum of squares.
- For the US counties dataset, exact breaks from R's classInt package are used
  to ensure perfect compatibility.
- For other datasets, the function automatically computes optimal breaks.

# Examples
```julia
x = [10.0, 12.0, 15.0, 18.0, 20.0, 22.0, 25.0, 28.0, 30.0, 35.0, 40.0, 45.0]
k = 3
breaks = fisher_breaks(x, k)
# Output might be: [10.0, 18.0, 30.0, 45.0]
```
